We provide code part for TelcoCustomer data, which can be found on Kaggle, following this link 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn .


This project focuses on predicting customer churn (i.e., whether a customer will leave a telecom company) using machine learning techniques. 

The model is trained on customer data, including demographics and usage patterns, to predict the likelihood of churn. This can help telecom companies retain customers by identifying at-risk customers and taking appropriate actions.
